        This is a duplication of a post I wrote for the BBC &quot;responsive news&quot; blog. It discusses the BBC News' open-source project Imager.js and how it helps with implementing a responsive images solution on a very large scale web application.

        <title>Stark - Simplified separation of components into decoupled applications</title>

        <description>
        Stark isn't a framework (or all-encompassing suite of tools). It is a 'strategy', a pattern for handling the architecture of your front-end code.

        <description>
        This is a continuation from my previous Grunt post where I was trying to dynamically update the main Grunt file at runtime. Seems there is a better (and more official) way to do this using aspects of the Grunt API

        <title>The Clean Coder - How to be a Professional</title>

        <description>
        A quick review of Robert C. Martin's book &quot;The Clean Coder&quot; (which is a follow-up to his classic &quot;Clean Code&quot;). The subject isn't actually about code this time but about how to act and think like a professional. This is a fantastic read and would be very useful to both developers and managers alike.

        Grunt is a JavaScript task runner. In this article I break down my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Integralist/Grunt-Boilerplate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grunt Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; which is a base project set-up using Grunt to take care of some standard tasks such as compiling AMD modules using RequireJS, watching/compiling Sass into CSS, watching and linting JS code as well as running unit tests.

        <description>
        After reading through Sandi Metz' book Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby I wanted to make sure I put down in a blog post (a distilled) break-down of all the great advice she provides (note that this post is mainly for my own reference/reminder, I strongly recommend you read the book as there is so much more you'll gain from reading the book compared to this post)
